            Ethiopian cuisine is the most common cuisine in Ethiopia.
            Its main ingredients are legumes of all kinds, edible vegetables and herbs, and meat and fish (depending on the region).
            This cuisine is based on long-cooked dishes and stews, generously seasoned and often spicy. 
            The extensive use of spices gives the dishes aromatic flavors and a diverse range of flavors.
    
            The kitchen in the traditional Ethiopian house is the center of the house 
            and the meals are conducted with a large plate in the center with a variety of dishes 
            (commonly called "watts") placed on the injera - flat bread (with a texture similar to salt) sour, 
            made from fermented teff flour. The diners make pieces of injera using their right hand and thus collect from the various dishes
             in wiping motions. The communal and ceremonial eating strengthens the bonds between the diners and it is even customary for a diner to feed the person sitting next to him as a gesture of respect, love and appreciation when the size of the portion indicates the generosity and generosity of the feeder. The meal concludes with a coffee-making ceremony known as "Buna."
